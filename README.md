Credit Risk Assessment
This project implements a Credit Risk Assessment model using machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of loan default based on customer and loan data.

📊 Project Overview
Credit risk assessment is crucial for financial institutions to make informed lending decisions. This notebook provides:

Data preprocessing and exploration

Feature selection and encoding

Model training and evaluation

Risk prediction using multiple ML models

🔧 Technologies Used
Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn

🗃️ Dataset
The dataset used contains features related to loan applicants such as:

Age

Credit score

Employment type

Loan amount

Annual income

Loan purpose

Default history, etc.

📈 Model Performance
Various classification models are tested, such as:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC are used to evaluate the models.

✅ Results
The final model achieves [X]% accuracy and [Y]% AUC, indicating strong predictive power for identifying high-risk applicants.

📌 Future Improvements
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Incorporating external credit bureau data

Model deployment with a Flask/Django web app
